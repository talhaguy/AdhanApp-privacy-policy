                <p>
                    Muhammad Talha built NMZ App as
                    a free app. This SERVICE is provided by
                    Muhammad Talha at no cost and is intended for use as
                    is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                    policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                    Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                    the collection and use of information in relation to this
                    policy.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The Service does not collect any user information at this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Service utilizes user location through Apple's CoreLocation API. This
                    information is stored on the user device and used in the Service, however, I do not
                    collect it.
                </p>
                <p><strong>3rd Party Libraries</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I employ the use of a 3rd party prayer times calculation
                    library, <a href="https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-swift" target="_blank">Adhan Swift</a>
                    to provide accurate timings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I may update our Privacy Policy from

                    As of 2020-04-18, no information is being collected. In future releases,
                    I may decide to add error logging or user interaction data collection in
                    order to improve the Service. If that happens, our Privacy Policy will
                    be updated to reflect it.
